# A simplified real-world-project Movie Booking App üé¨ üçø built with Flutter, Clean Template, BLoC, REST API, Firebase Auth, and Unit Tests (future).

> I‚Äôve open-sourced this project to showcase some of my skills and to help early-career Flutter developers grow in their career.
>
> Like ["Nezha: Birth Of The Demon Child"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdOgym7MLAU), I believe that for those just starting out in Flutter, completing this project might be a challenge. However, once you get through it, you‚Äôll either succeed or grow stronger. (Kh√¥ng th√†nh c√¥ng c≈©ng th√†nh nh√¢n) (Â§±Ë¥•‰πüÊòØÊàêÂäü)

## Happy new year 2025 üéâ

2025 kicks off with AI evolving at an incredible pace, but also brings a wave of layoffs in the IT industry. Don‚Äôt be too afraid! This is not the end‚Äîstay patient, keep learning, and wait for the right moment.

And what could be better than starting a new project to kick off the year?

## üé¨ Cinema Booking

### What Cinema Booking ?

Cinema Booking is an application that helps users search for and book movie tickets at cinemas in Hanoi. The app offers a user-friendly and cinematic interface, quick operations, and a convenient ticket-booking experience.

It leverages Flutter Clean Architecture and Flutter BLoC, ensuring a well-structured and scalable design that facilitates future growth, comprehensive testing, and efficient QA processes. That also makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach UseCase in the future

### Cinema Booking components

This is the collection of components that I developer for [Cinema Booking](https://github.com/ChunhThanhDe/cinema-booking), includes:

- [x] Splash and Get Start (#8 feat screen splash) (#10 feat get-start welcome screen)
- [x] Login (#19 feat login screen)
- [x] Home Main (#20 feat home screen)
- [x] Movie Detail (#25 feat detail movie screen)
- [x] Search All Movie (#28 feat all movie screen)
- [x] Booking Tickets Movie (#33 feat booking movie tickets screen)
- [x] Tickets hold (#38 feat screen tickets hold)
- [x] Mock API Postman for RestAPI

#### More to come... 

- [ ] Payment Screen
- [ ] Search All Cinema in Hanoi
- [ ] Crawl data from Cinema Website
- [ ] IOS version
- { } Web version

## Who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I have been working with Flutter and Java for about three years. I built cool stuff at [VNPT Technology][zyllem] but most of them are system applications based on AOSP source code and are under security contracts, making it difficult to showcase them..

This is a showcase user-facing application that I built in my spare time to expand my experience in application development and explore various technologies and new libraries I wanted to try, such as `Firebase`, `Google Maps`, `Payment`,... and more.

There are many Flutter examples on the web but most of them are way too simple. I like to think that this codebase contains enough complexity to offer valuable insights to **Flutter developers of all skill levels** while still being _relatively_ easy to understand.

This piece of work is also part of my technical series [Flutter-Journey](https://github.com/Flutter-Journey), which aims to empower developers to **build and scale their own Flutter applications**. My desire is to advocate and grow the Flutter developer community in Vietnam.
