# A simplified real-world-project Movie Booking App 🎬 🍿 built with Flutter, Clean Template, BLoC, REST API, Firebase Auth, and Unit Tests (future).

> I’ve open-sourced this project to showcase some of my skills and to help early-career Flutter developers grow in their career.
>
> Like ["Nezha: Birth Of The Demon Child"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdOgym7MLAU), I believe that for those just starting out in Flutter, completing this project might be a challenge. However, once you get through it, you’ll either succeed or grow stronger. (Không thành công cũng thành nhân) (失败也是成功)
>
> I’ll also support so feel free to start with new issue if you have difficulty because I know it’s not as easy for everyone. :muscle:
